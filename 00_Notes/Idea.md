# flash-speed
**System Task:** You are to build a purely client-side, single-page application (SPA) that demonstrates "Mathematical Beauty in Code."

**Requirements:**

1. **No External Libraries:** You must not use Three.js, p5.js, or React. Use **Vanilla JS** and raw **SVG/Canvas API** only. I want to see your raw algorithm logic.
2. **Structure:** Create a clean navigation menu with 3 distinct "Galleries" (pages) that the user can switch between without reloading.
3. **The Galleries:**
* **Page 1: The "Recursive Nature" (Fractals):** Generate a dynamic fractal tree or Sierpiński triangle using recursive SVG paths. It must be animated (e.g., swaying in the wind or growing).
* **Page 2: The "Chaos Engine" (Physics):** Create a particle system using HTML5 Canvas. The particles should interact with mouse movement (attraction/repulsion) and obey basic laws of physics (momentum/friction).
* **Page 3: The "Sacred Geometry" (Vector Math):** Render a complex geometric pattern (like a Flower of Life or Metatron’s Cube) using strictly calculated SVG coordinates. It should include a color-shifting gradient based on time.


4. **Aesthetics:** The UI must be dark-mode, minimalist, and "futuristic." Use a monospace font for labels.

**Goal:** The code must be error-free, self-contained in one file (index.html), and visually stunning. Show me what you can do.
