# 🌌 The Render Test | LLM Visual Arena

A futuristic, high-end gallery designed to benchmark and showcase the visual and logical capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). This project doesn't just use LLMs—it evaluates them in a controlled, sandboxed environment.

## 🎯 The Vision
"The Render Test" provides a technical stage for models (like Gemini, Claude, and GPT) to demonstrate their ability to generate complex, self-contained SPAs, Sacred Geometry, Chaos Engines, and Recursive Fractals using only Vanilla JS, SVG, and Canvas APIs.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Secure Sandboxing**: Isolated `<iframe>` execution using `srcDoc` and the `sandbox` attribute to prevent script leaks.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Seamlessly switch between model "Contenders" with instantaneous re-mounting.
- **Triple-Metric Scoring**: Evaluation based on **Visual Beauty**, **Logic Coherence**, and **Technical Precision**.
- **Futuristic UI**: A premium dark-mode aesthetic built with Tailwind CSS, featuring glassmorphism and neon accents.
- **Source Inspector**: Instant toggle between the live render and the syntax-highlighted source code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Glassmorphism
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Data**: JSON-driven benchmark repository
